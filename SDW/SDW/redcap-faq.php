			A longitudinal project is similar to a traditional data collection project in that multiple data entry forms are defined. However unlike the traditional model, forms in a longitudinal project can be completed repeatedly for a single record. The longitudinal model allows any data entry page to be repeated any given number of times across pre-defined time-points, which are specified by the user before data is collected. So rather than repeating a data entry form multiple times in the Data Dictionary, it can exist only once in the Data Dictionary but be repeated N number of times using the longitudinal model.
			</p>
			<p>
			The longitudinal project lets you define "events" for your project that allow the utilization of data collection forms multiple times for any given database record. An "event" may be a temporal event in the course of your project such as a participant visit or a task to be performed. After events have been defined, you will need to designate the data entry forms that you wish to utilize for any or all events, thus allowing you to use a form for multiple events for the same database record. You may group your events into "arms" in which you may have one or more arms/groups for your project. Each arm can have as many events as you wish. You may use the table provided to create new events and/or arms, or modify existing ones. (One arm and one event will be initially defined as the default for all databases).

			In the traditional data collection model and for surveys, each project record is stored independently as a separate row of data, which can be seen when exported. But for longitudinal projects, each row of data actually represents that particular time-point (event) per database record. 
			</p>
			<p>
			For example, if four events are defined for the project, one record will have four separate rows of data when exported.  The data export will include a column "redcap_event_name" indicating the unique event name for each row.

		For a question with an unknown number of answers, such as how many medications someone is taking, you may want to display the fields only as they are needed. REDCap currently is not able to dynamically create fields; however, there is a way to use branching logic to approximate this.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you can estimate the maximum number of fields you will need, you can create that many copies of your field to hide and display as needed using branching logic. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<strong>Example 1</strong>: If you think 15 is a good maximum, you would create 15 copies of the field. Then, in order to only show the fields that are needed, you could create a "count" variable.  Your branching logic would look like this: 
		</p>
		<p>
		field1: [count]&gt;0 
		</p>
		<p>
		field2: [count]&gt;1 
		</p>
		<p>
		field3: [count]&gt;2 
		</p>
		<p>
		and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
		If your variable is medications, and the respondent takes 2 medications, you enter 2 in [count] variable, then the med1 and med2 fields appear. If they take 3, you enter that, and meds1 to med3 fields appear.
		</p>
		<p>
		<strong>Example 2:</strong> Another method is to first create the maximum number of fields that you estimate will be needed, as above, and then hide and display each field as the previous field receives data. Using this method will cause each field to show up as needed. Your branching logic would look like: 
		</p>
		<p>
		field2: [field1] &lt;&gt; "" 
		</p>
		<p>
		field3: [field1] &lt;&gt; "" and [field2] &lt;&gt; "" 
		</p>
		<p>
		field4: [field1] &lt;&gt; "" and [field2] &lt;&gt; "" and [field3] &lt;&gt; "" 
		</p>
		<p>
		and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
		The fields in this example are text fields.  If field1 "does not equal blank" (aka if data is entered for field1), then field2 will display.
		</p>

		</p>

		The method by which REDCap performs calculations (using JavaScript, a common technology found in all web browsers) is known in rare cases to have calculation precision issues (e.g. the result of a complex calculation should be 0.06 but instead results as 0.06000000000000000005). However, such precision errors are very uncommon and are very seldom ever experienced. This can often be remedied by strategically using the REDCap round() function within your calculation; however it is not 100% preventative for all cases.

		To calculate BMI (body mass index) from height and weight, you can create \'BMI\' as a calculated field, as seen below. When values for height and weight are entered, REDCap will calculate the "BMI" field. The data for a calculated field are saved to the database when the form is saved and can be exported just like all other fields.
		 
		To create a calculated field, you will need to do two things:
		</p>
		<p>
		1) Set the Field Type of the new field as Calculated Field in the Online Designer, or \'calc\' if you are working in the data dictionary spreadsheet.
		</p>
		<p>
		2) Provide the equation for the calculation in the Calculation Equation section of the Online Designer or the \'Choices OR Calculations\' column in the data dictionary spreadsheet.

		Yes, for longitudinal projects (i.e. with multiple events defined), a calculated field's equation may utilize fields from other events (i.e. visits, time-points). The equation format is somewhat different from the normal format because the unique event name must be specified in the equation for the target event. The unique event name must be prepended (in square brackets) to the beginning of the variable name (in square brackets), i.e. [unique_event_name][variable_name]. Unique event names can be found listed on the project's Define My Event's page on the right-hand side of the events table, in which the unique name is automatically generated from the event name that you have defined. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For example, if the first event in the project is named \"Enrollment\", in which the unique event name for it is \"enrollment_arm_1\", then we can set up the equation as follows to perform a calculation utilizing the \"weight\" field from the Enrollment event: [enrollment_arm_1][weight]/[visit_weight]. Thus, presuming that this calculated field exists on a form that is utilized on multiple events, it will always perform the calculation using the value of weight from the Enrollment event while using the value of visit_weight for the current event the user is on.

		Branching Logic may be employed when fields in the database need to be hidden during certain circumstances. For instance, it may be best to hide fields related to pregnancy if the subject in the database is male. If you wish to make a field visible ONLY when the values of other fields meet certain conditions (and keep it invisible otherwise), you may provide these conditions in the Branching Logic section in the Online Designer (shown by the double green arrow icon), or the Branching Logic column in the Data Dictionary.
		</p>
		<p>
		For basic branching, you can simply drag and drop field names as needed in the Branching Logic dialog box in the Online Designer. If your branching logic is more complex, or if you are working in the Data Dictionary, you will create equations using the syntax described below.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the equation you must use the project variable names surrounded by <strong>[ ]</strong> brackets. You may use mathematical operators (=,&lt;,&gt;,&lt;=,&gt;=,&lt;&gt;) and Boolean logic (and/or).  You may nest within many parenthetical levels for more complex logic. 
		</p>
		<p>
		You must <strong>ALWAYS</strong> put single or double quotes around the values in the equation UNLESS you are using &gt; or &lt; with numerical values.
		</p>
		<p>
		The field for which you are constructing the Branching Logic will ONLY be displayed when its equation has been evaluated as TRUE. Please note that for items that are coded numerically, such as dropdowns and radio buttons, you will need to provide the coded numerical value in the equation (rather than the displayed text label).

	1 => '<p>
		Yes, for longitudinal projects (i.e. with multiple events defined), branching logic may utilize fields from other events (i.e. visits, time-points). The branching logic format is somewhat different from the normal format because the unique event name must be specified in the logic for the target event. The unique event name must be prepended (in square brackets) to the beginning of the variable name (in square brackets), i.e. [unique_event_name][variable_name]. Unique event names can be found listed on the project\'s Define My Event\'s page on the right-hand side of the events table, in which the unique name is automatically generated from the event name that you have defined. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For example, if the first event in the project is named "Enrollment", in which the unique event name for it is "enrollment_arm_1", then we can set up the branching logic utilizing the "weight" field from the Enrollment event: [enrollment_arm_1][weight]/[visit_weight] &gt; 1. Thus, presuming that this field exists on a form that is utilized on multiple events, it will always perform the branching logic using the value of weight from the Enrollment event while using the value of visit_weight for the current event the user is on.

		You are encountering a limitation that stems from having a lot of fields especially multiple choice fields in your project. If a good number of your fields involve multiple choices then the number of choices that the Drag-N-Drop Logic Builder has to load into the pop-up really gets high. So just having a lot of fields with several choices each can slow down the system.  The performance is further affected because REDCap uses javascript (powered by the user"\'"s browser) to do the drag-n-drop and also to process the conversion of the advanced syntax to the drag-n-drop method (if you decide to switch methods within the pop-up). 
		</p>
		<p>
		The slower your computer and the slower your browser (Internet Explorer is the worst, especially versions 6 and 7), then the slower the drag-n-drop method will be.

		</p>
		<p>
		From REDCap 4.3.0 onward, warnings have been added to alert users who use any of the IE-reserved field names such as return.  \"New\" and \"return\" have been added as reserved variable names in 4.3.0.  In 4.3.1 the words \"continue\", \"case\", \"class\", and \"enum\" have been added.  So if the user tries to create a variable name that uses one of those words, REDCap will require him or her to change it.

		REDCap can display a matrix group of fields in either Single Answer format (i.e. radio buttons) or Multiple Answer format (i.e. checkboxes). A matrix allows you to display a group of similar multiple choice fields in a very compact area on a page. This makes data entry forms and surveys much shorter looking. Using matrix fields is especially desirable on surveys because survey respondents are much less likely to leave a survey uncompleted if the survey appears shorter, as opposed to looking very long, which can feel daunting to a respondent. So having compact sections of questions can actually improve a survey"\'"s response rate. A matrix can have as many rows or columns as needed. Although the more choices you have, the narrower each choice column will be. Any field in a matrix can optionally have its own branching logic and can be set individually as a required field.  A matrix can also optionally have a section header.

Then set its field label in column E, its multiple choice options in column F, and then lastly in column P you must provide a Matrix Group Name. (The matrix group name is how REDCap knows to display these fields together as a matrix. Without a matrix group name, REDCap will merely display the fields separately as normal radio buttons or checkboxes.) The matrix group name is merely a tag that is used to group all the fields together in a single matrix group. The matrix group name can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores, and the group name must not duplicate any other matrix group name in the project.

A matrix can be created only if those three conditions are met. The conversion of regular checkbox/radio fields into a matrix of fields cannot be done in the Online Designer but only using the Data Dictionary. To accomplish this, you will first need to download the existing data dictionary for the project, which can be done on the "Upload Data Dictionary" page.

	1 => "<p>
		Yes, this can be done so that when a survey participant initially loads the survey page, it already has questions pre-filled with values. This can be done two different ways as seen below. Please note that even if a survey is a multi-page survey, questions on later pages can also be pre-filled using these methods. <i>NOTE: These two methods are likely to be only used for public survey links (as opposed to using the Participants List). This is because there is not a real opportunity to modify the survey links sent to participants via the Participants List because REDCap automatically sends them out as-is.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
		<strong>1) Append values to the survey link:</strong>
		The first method is for pre-filling survey questions by simply appending URL parameters to a survey link. The format for adding URL parameters is to add an ampersand (&amp;) to the end of the survey link, followed by the REDCap variable name of the question you wish to pre-fill, followed by an equals sign (=), then followed by the value you wish to pre-fill in that question. For example, if the survey URL is <i>https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=dA78HM</i>, then the URL below would pre-fill \"Jon\" for the first name question, \"Doe\" for last name, set the multiple choice field named \"gender\" to \"Male\" (whose raw/coded value is \"1\"), and it would check off options 2 and 3 for the \"race\" checkbox. <strong>WARNING: This method is not considered secure for transmitting confidential or identifying information (e.g. SSN, name), even when using over SSL/HTTPS. If you wish to pre-fill such information, it is highly recommended to use method 2 below.</strong>
		</p>
		<pre class=\"wiki\"  style=\"background-color:#EEE; border: 1px solid #CCC; text-align:center; padding-top:5px;\">https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=dA78HM&amp;first_name=Jon&amp;last_name=Doe&amp;gender=1&amp;race___2=1&amp;race___3=1
		</pre><p>
		<strong>2) Submit an HTML form to a REDCap survey from another webpage:</strong>
		The second method is for pre-filling survey questions by posting the values from another webpage using an HTML form. This webpage can be *any* webpage on *any* server. See the example below. The form\"'\"s \"method\" must be \"post\" and its \"action\" must be the survey link URL. The form\'s submit button must have the name \"__prefill\" (its value does not matter). Each question you wish to pre-fill will be represented as a field in the form, in which the field\'s \"name\" attribute is the REDCap variable name and its value is the question value you wish to pre-fill on the survey page. The form field may be an input, textarea, or select field. (The example below shows them all as hidden input fields, which could presumably have been loaded dynamically, and thus do not need to display their value.) If submitted, the form below would pre-fill \"Jon\" for the first name question, \"Doe\" for last name, set the multiple choice field named \"gender\" to \"Male\" (whose raw/coded value is \"1\"), and it would check off options 2 and 3 for the \"race\" checkbox. In this example, the only thing that would be seen on the webpage is the \"Pre-fill Survey\" button.

They will not be able to access each other\"'\"s data, and only normal users (called Reviewers) will be able to see all the data in the database.

Only one person at a time can be set as person 1 or 2. All other users are considered Reviewers. Reviewers have the ability to merge a record created by person 1 and 2 after viewing differences and adjudicating those differences using the Data Comparison Tool, thus creating a third record in the set.

		<strong>It is sometimes recommended to use the Data Access Groups over the actual DDE module to implement a form of double data entry.</strong> The advantages of using DAGs include allowing an unlimited number of users to be in a group and enter data, to utilize the Data Import Tool, and to access all Applications pages. Discrepancies between double-entered records can be resolved by a "reviewer" (i.e. someone not in a group) using the Data Comparison Tool. However, two records can ONLY be merged together when using the DDE module.

		Yes. You may use conditional logic (i.e. an IF/THEN/ELSE statement) by using the function <strong>if (CONDITION, value if condition is TRUE, value if condition is FALSE)</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		This construction is similar to IF statements in Microsoft Excel. Provide the condition first (e.g. [weight]=4), then give the resulting value if it is true, and lastly give the resulting value if the condition is false.  For example:
		</p>
		<p>
		<strong> if([weight] &gt; 100, 44, 11) &lt; [other_field]</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		In this example, if the value of the field \'weight\' is greater than 100, then it will give a value of 44, but if \'weight\' is less than or equal to 100, it will give 11 as the result.

		You can calculate the difference between two dates or times by using the datediff function shown below. <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> The Data Quality datediff function differs from the datediff function used in calculated fields in that the DQ datediff does NOT have a "dateformat" parameter. This is due to the fact that the date format of the dates used in the DQ datediff function does not have to be specified, whereas it does for calc fields.

		<ul><li>The parameter returnSignedValue denotes the result to be signed or unsigned (absolute value), in which the default value is "false", which returns the absolute value of the difference. For example, if [date1] is larger than [date2], then the result will be negative if returnSignedValue is set to true. If returnSignedValue is not set or is set to false, then the result will ALWAYS be a positive number. If returnSignedValue is set to false or not set, then the order of the dates in the equation does not matter because the resulting value will always be positive (although the + sign is not displayed but implied).

		</td></tr><tr><td><strong>datediff([dob],"05-31-2007","h",true)</strong> </td><td> Yields the number of hours between May 31, 2007, and the date for the dob field. Because returnSignedValue is set to true, the value will be negative if the dob field value is more recent than May 31, 2007.
